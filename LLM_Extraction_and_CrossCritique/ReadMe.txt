Python script is provided in the "Code" folder.
Training studies are provided in the "training_studies" folder.
Test stufies are provided in the "test_studies" folder.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jupyter Notebook is required to execute the script, the script can be execute using following plateforms:
1) Kaggle
2) Colab
3) Local Machine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Libraries Required for Local Machines: tiktoken, PyMuPDF, openai, anthropic + (pandas, re, time, os, numpy, requests, math, base64) 
Libraries Required for Kaggle: tiktoken, PyMuPDF, openai, anthropic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You don't required to change the code to reproduce the results, the code required the following inputs from user:

INPUT:
------
i   - Model-Name    = claude-3-opus-20240229 / gpt-4-0125-preview --- For initial testing, it is recommended to use gpt-3.5-turbo (to save the cost)
ii  - Model-Key     = APIKey for Cluade or GPT (purchased APIKey)
iii - pdf_folder    = path to the folder that contains pdf files (in this case, for training, we provide the path to "training_studies" folder)
iv  - variable_file = Path to the variable file (This file contains all the variables that need to be extracted)
v   - prompt_size   = Enter the number of variables for each prompt (integer number (1, 3, 5, 10, etc.))
			Each prompt will contain N number of variables -- if we select N=5, and # of variable = 10, we will have 2 prompts (each with 5 variables)
OUTPUT:
-------
The code will produce 2 files of responses
1) The first file will contain the raw responses for all the provided files for all variables
2) The second file will contain the post-processed (using GPT model) responses for all the raw responses
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disagreement-Resolution:
------------------------
We used two LLMs for extraction, according to initial results, we found that the extraction results are highly accurate when both LLMs generate agreement.
In some cases, the responses of both LLMs were different, so we presented a solution based on cross-critique where each LLM take the output responses of other LLM and verify its result.
	In most of the cases, both LLMs generate agreed response (at the second level, after cross-critque)

To execute the cross-critque code (provided at the end of the Notebook shared in the "Code" folder), you will require following information in the file:

File:
-----
Annotated Agreement Matching File

Information in the File:
------------------------
Variable -- GPT_Responses -- CLAUDE_Responses -- Gold_Standard -- Agree(A)/Disagree(D)

The disagreement-resolution code will be executed twice:
i) It will take the claude response and verify using GPT, ii) Vice-Versa

To execute these setting you only need to change the model name -- the script will automatically do the rest.
